# MCS2018: Adversarial Attacks on Black-box Face Recognition using pytorch

My submission uses combination of following papers:
Among 129 participant my implementation stands 14 position.

Todos for improvements:
   <ul>
   <li>Try ADAM,SGD with momentum for better result</li>
    <li>Use Data Augmentation(Random Erase, flip, color channel transformation)</li>
    <li>Make substitute model for blackbox</li>
    <li>Try different feature extractor for source and target image.</li>
     <li>Add Preprocessing for face to remove bias, noise and enhance the image quality before feeding to net</li>
   </ul>
